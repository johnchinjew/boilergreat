# J.E.T.S. *Just enough to start!*
> A boilerplate with Just Enough To Start!

Jets is a terse and functional boilerplate made to be the perfect static site starter kit. It's a flexible skeleton that holds just enough metadatas, cascading coolness, and cheezy stock pics, to cut out the overhead and get you started quickly.

Jets is mostly empty, the rest is yours to fill... Make something awesome!
